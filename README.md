# Kony Docs
This page serves as the landing page for the POC to test GitHub as a possible candidate to host Kony docs. 
In this POC, we will cover two areas of Kony Visualizer Documentation. 
Widget Guide: In the Widget guide, we will see how the Segmented UI widget appears in GitHub
API Guide: In the API guide, we will view one API in action in [GitHub](GitTest.htm)
